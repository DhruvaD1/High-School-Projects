# High-School-Projects
This Repo has a link to a collection of projects in Software Development and 3D CAD that I have created in High School that I have decided to post here. It has a Twitch Bot, Path Finder, a Unity Game, and more. These projects were made a while back and helped me learn to program. This website was made before I had any web dev experience so wix was used 3 years ago

Here is the link to the projects https://dhruvad201.wixsite.com/portfolio/programming-arduino-projects
